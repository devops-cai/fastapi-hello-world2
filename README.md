Please use this documentation with new-branch

This is a simple MERN application - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (Currently ERN only may be as we are not using MongoDB)

Which utilizes python in backend whith dependecies as mentioned in requirement.txt

Note : 

1) As per code the code we have set it it on windows .So , you may have to change your sh scripts as your setup environment for conda source path can be different
2) In our code we are using conda environment with name fastapi

-----------------------------Manual flow of Code-----------------------------

Step 1 - Run .sh scripts and check if all the ports are active (localhost:8000,..............)
